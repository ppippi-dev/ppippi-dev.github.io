## Welcome to ppippi-dev Blog

Hello! I'm a developer with hands-on experience across MLOps, AI, and Cloud technologies.

### About Me

I'm particularly passionate about deploying and operating machine learning systems in production environments, building stable and scalable AI infrastructure in cloud-native settings. This blog is where I share not just theoretical knowledge, but practical experiences and problem-solving processes from real projects.

### Blog Philosophy

This blog is more than just a collection of technical documentation—it's a space for recording real-world problems encountered during development and their solutions. By transparently sharing my trial-and-error processes and learning journey, I aim to provide practical help to other developers facing similar challenges.

**Core Values:**
- **Practicality**: Work-focused content that can be immediately applied to real projects
- **Depth**: Covering not just surface-level usage, but underlying principles and best practices
- **Accuracy**: Reliable content based on verified information and actual experience
- **Continuous Improvement**: Updating and improving content to match technological changes

### Main Topics

#### MLOps & AI Infrastructure
Covering the entire process of deploying and operating machine learning models in production environments. Deep dives into model serving, monitoring, A/B testing, retraining pipelines, and other essential production skills.

#### LLMOps & Agent Development
Exploring the latest LLM technologies and AI Agent development. Sharing real implementation cases and architecture design experiences using various frameworks like OpenAI API, LangChain, and Google ADK.

#### Cloud & DevOps
Sharing infrastructure building experiences on major cloud platforms including AWS, GCP, and Azure. Covering Infrastructure as Code using Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and CI/CD pipeline construction.

#### Data Engineering
Covering core data engineering topics including data pipeline construction, ETL/ELT processes, and data quality management.
