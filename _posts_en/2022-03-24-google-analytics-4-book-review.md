Many people chant “data is important,” yet aren’t sure how it’s actually used. This book demystifies Google Analytics 4—the most accessible way to analyze web/app data—with practical examples and hands-on labs.

### Who Should Read It?

- Anyone learning GA4: data analysts, marketers, product managers, executives—anyone who relies on metrics to make decisions.
- Professionals outside data teams who need to understand metrics well enough to collaborate effectively.

Personally, the book helped me appreciate what data folks need and how they use GA4 to answer business questions.

### What’s Inside

It starts with terminology—sessions, events, users, new users, etc.—and clarifies common points of confusion. Even if you don’t have your own site, the author provides demo accounts and step-by-step exercises.

Beyond the basics, the book walks through real-world scenarios: which metrics matter, how to interpret them, and what to watch out for. The numerous screenshots make it easy to follow along.

### Highlights

- Hands-on, beginner-friendly walkthroughs of GA4 features.
- Clear explanations of potentially confusing concepts.
- Plenty of examples showing how to extract meaningful insights.

### Shortcomings

- Statistical concepts (cohort analysis, GA4’s built-in stats) are glossed over. Since the book targets beginners, this might be intentional, but I would’ve liked deeper coverage there.

### Final Thoughts

I’d been “meaning to learn GA4 someday” for too long. This book finally nudged me into action. It reinforced that staring at dashboards isn’t enough—we need to interpret the numbers and act on them. If GA4 has been on your to-learn list, this is a solid starting point.***
