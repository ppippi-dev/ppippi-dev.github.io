Recently, numerous Agent development tools have been emerging. Among them, Google's **ADK (Agent Development Kit)** stands out as one of the most notable open-source projects, presenting a new turning point in the Agent ecosystem.

As its name suggests, ADK is an "Agent Development Kit" that goes beyond a simple SDK level by providing a **standardized Agent development framework** based on the **A2A (Agent to Agent)** protocol. This allows developers to design and deploy Agents in a standardized manner without having to directly implement complex inter-Agent communication logic.


### ADK's Differentiators

The AI agent ecosystem is currently crowded with various frameworks. While numerous open-source projects like LangChain, AutoGen, Agno, Swarm, and CrewAI exist, they primarily focus on implementing individual Agent functionalities or workflow-oriented combinations. In contrast, **ADK focuses on standardizing communication and interaction between Agents (A2A)**.

In other words, **ADK differentiates itself by providing infrastructure-level standards that enable multiple Agents to collaborate, rather than being just a single Agent development tool**.

### ADK's Philosophy: Standardized Collaboration

ADK's philosophy is clear — **"Standardize collaboration between AI Agents."**

Existing Agent systems had closed structures that only operated within their own frameworks. However, ADK expands this into **an environment where all Agents can communicate in a common language, much like HTTP protocol on the internet**. Thanks to this, Agents created by different teams or organizations can easily integrate through the same A2A protocol.

### What We'll Cover

In this series, we'll explore ADK's overall structure step by step.

1. Understanding ADK's philosophy and basic concepts
2. Hands-on practice building simple Agents using ADK SDK
3. Configuring MCP servers and connecting Tools
4. Designing Multi-Agent Orchestration based on A2A communication

Now, in the next chapter, let's take a deeper look at ADK's philosophy and core concepts.
