title: ADK Basic Setup
---


Now let’s properly test ADK.

Everything here is tested using the Python SDK.

## Test environment

Here’s what I’m using:

- Python 3.12
- uv
- gpt-5-nano

ADK really shines with Gemini and Vertex AI. However, to compare its strengths and differences with other tools, we’ll use a third-party LLM.

## Environment setup

First, set up uv as follows. If you don’t have pyenv or uv installed, install them first or skip these steps and use your own setup.

```bash
mkdir adk-test && cd adk-test
pyenv local 3.12.7
uv init
uv venv
uv add google-adk
```

With the commands above, the environment setup is complete.

## Create an ADK Agent

```bash
uv run adk create my_agent
```

When you run this command, you’ll see options like below. I chose 2.

```bash
Choose a model for the root agent:
1. gemini-2.5-flash
2. Other models (fill later)
Choose model (1, 2): 2
```

## Configure the LLM model

Now prepare the LLM model. I’ll set this up using pydantic.

```bash
uv add pydantic-settings
```



```python
"""pydantic Settings"""

from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    """Settings for the application"""

    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env")
    OPENAI_API_KEY: str = ""
    OPENAI_MODEL: str = "gpt-5-nano"

settings = Settings()
```

Set it up like above, then provide OPENAI_API_KEY via a .env file or by exporting it, for example: export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-~~".

Next, set up litellm. With ADK, to use models other than Gemini or Vertex AI, you need to go through the litellm library. This adds an extra dependency and a middle layer, which makes it more complex than a direct integration—likely one downside of ADK.

```bash
uv add litellm
```

After that, configure my_agent/agent.py like this:



```python
"""My Agent"""

from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent
from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm

from settings import settings

root_agent = Agent(
    model=LiteLlm(model=settings.OPENAI_MODEL),
    name="root_agent",
    description="A helpful assistant for user questions.",
    instruction="Answer user questions to the best of your knowledge",
)
```

## Run the Agent

We’ve now set up a very simple Agent. Let’s run it.

```bash
uv run adk run my_agent
```

When you run the command above, you’ll see a [user]: prompt, and it will respond to your input.

```bash
[user]: hello
23:24:51 - LiteLLM:INFO: utils.py:3416 - 
LiteLLM completion() model= gpt-5-nano; provider = openai
[root_agent]: Hello! How can I help today? I can answer questions, explain concepts, help with writing, brainstorm ideas, plan tasks, or provide quick summaries. If you have a topic in mind, tell me and I’ll dive in.
```

## Use the web interface

If you want a more distinctive ADK experience, there’s also a way to test via the web.

```bash
uv run adk web
```

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and you’ll see a screen like this.

This is ADK’s built-in web interface, which lets you visually monitor the Agent’s execution. After entering a prompt, you can monitor the run as shown below.
