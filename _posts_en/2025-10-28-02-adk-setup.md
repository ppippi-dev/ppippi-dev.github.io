title: ADK Basic Setup
---


Let’s dive into testing ADK.

All examples are tested using the Python SDK.

## Test Environment

My setup:

- Python 3.12
- uv
- gpt-5-nano

ADK really shines with Gemini and Vertex AI. However, to compare strengths and differences with other tools, we’ll use a third-party LLM.

## Environment Setup

First, set up uv as follows. If you don’t have pyenv and uv installed, install them first or skip those steps and use your own environment.

```bash
mkdir adk-test && cd adk-test
pyenv local 3.12.7
uv init
uv venv
uv add google-adk
```

With the commands above, the environment setup is complete.

## Create an ADK Agent

```bash
uv run adk create my_agent
```

When you run the command, you’ll see options like below; I chose 2.

```bash
Choose a model for the root agent:
1. gemini-2.5-flash
2. Other models (fill later)
Choose model (1, 2): 2
```

## Configure the LLM

Now prepare the LLM. I’ll use pydantic-settings for this setup.

```bash
uv add pydantic-settings
```



```python
"""pydantic Settings"""

from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    """Settings for the application"""

    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env")
    OPENAI_API_KEY: str = ""
    OPENAI_MODEL: str = "gpt-5-nano"

settings = Settings()
```

With the setup above, set OPENAI_API_KEY via a .env file or export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-~~" and you’re done.



Next, set up litellm. To use models other than Gemini or Vertex AI with ADK, you need to go through the litellm library. This adds an extra dependency and a middle layer, making it more complex than a direct integration—likely one drawback of ADK.

```bash
uv add litellm
```

After installing, configure my_agent/agent.py like this:



```python
"""My Agent"""

from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent
from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm

from settings import settings

root_agent = Agent(
    model=LiteLlm(model=settings.OPENAI_MODEL),
    name="root_agent",
    description="A helpful assistant for user questions.",
    instruction="Answer user questions to the best of your knowledge",
)
```

## Run the Agent

Our simple agent is ready. Let’s run it.

```bash
uv run adk run my_agent
```

When you run the command, you’ll see a [user]: prompt; enter something and you’ll get a response.

```bash
[user]: hello
23:24:51 - LiteLLM:INFO: utils.py:3416 - 
LiteLLM completion() model= gpt-5-nano; provider = openai
[root_agent]: Hello! How can I help today? I can answer questions, explain concepts, help with writing, brainstorm ideas, plan tasks, or provide quick summaries. If you have a topic in mind, tell me and I’ll dive in.
```

## Use the Web Interface

If you want a more distinctive ADK experience, you can also test via the web.

```bash
uv run adk web
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see a screen like this.

This uses ADK’s built-in web interface, letting you visually monitor an agent’s execution. After you submit a prompt, you can monitor it as shown below.
