### Intro

It’s been just over three months since I joined my first company as a data engineer at a mobility platform. I’m fascinated by data engineering, infrastructure, visualization, and DL/ML—here’s what I’ve learned so far.

<br>

### Hiring Journey

- A notification from Wanted led me to a company I admired.
- The recruitment session sold me on their vision, so I applied.
- Coding test: 3 questions / 2 hours. Focused more on clean code and complexity than tricky algorithms.
- **Interview 1** (technical) felt like mentoring—discussed my capstone, pipeline design, and received constructive feedback.
- **Interview 2** (culture fit) with the CTO was intense; probing “why” questions and pressure testing logic. I thought I bombed it… but got an offer.

### Onboarding

- One month of onboarding: Airflow, Python-based services, Docker/Kubernetes, CI/CD, etc.
- Learned the team’s tech stack via structured tasks and by shadowing teammates.
- Company-sponsored education budget helped me fill gaps quickly.

### Day-to-Day (Data Infrastructure)

- Working on cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, monitoring, and more.
- I’ve already caused a few mishaps—but each incident became a learning opportunity. Supportive teammates emphasized “you learn the most from mistakes.”

### Observations & Lessons

1. **Amazing teammates** – strong engineering skills, communication, and ownership. I feel lucky to learn from them.
2. **The only true “newbie”** – others had 1–2 years of experience, which pushed me to work harder.
3. **Real collaboration** – GitHub, Slack, Notion, Jira, pair work… collaboration is much more than committing code.
4. **Code reviews** – readability matters; writing for the team, not just myself. I’m also learning to review others’ code effectively.
5. **Vocabulary overload** – agile terms, infra jargon… I’m still catching up.
6. **Flat culture** – everyone uses English nicknames (no honorifics). Weird at first, now it feels natural.
7. **Trust + freedom** – the company grants autonomy but expects accountability. It’s the work culture I hoped for.
8. **Rest is a skill** – colleagues have diverse hobbies (fitness, travel). I realized I need one too.

Overall, I’m grateful—getting paid to learn, feeling rapid growth, and wanting to become someone my teammates can rely on. My new question: “Beyond technical stacks, what does a healthy engineering culture look like, and how can I contribute to it?”***
