SQL is the indispensable weapon for working with relational databases. Hoping to sharpen my skills, I picked up *SQL Cookbook*—and was immediately intimidated by its 668 pages. Fortunately, it’s code-heavy, so the reading felt lighter than the page count suggests.

<br>

### Who Should Read This?

According to the preface (which I only checked *after* finishing), the book targets SQL users who already understand the basics and want to go further. That’s accurate: even though I thought I knew standard queries, I encountered many new techniques. If you’re brand new to SQL, this isn’t the right starting point.

<br>

### What’s Inside

As the title implies, this is a cookbook of SQL “recipes.” It covers:
- Simple SELECT queries.
- String, numeric, and date manipulation.
- Advanced search strategies.
- Reporting-style queries.

There’s plenty of “I didn’t know SQL could do that” moments. Two-thirds of the book is pure code snippets. While I primarily use PostgreSQL and MySQL, the examples span DB2, Oracle, and SQL Server as well. Even when I didn’t practice every snippet, skimming the variations was enlightening—Oracle’s syntax in particular stands out.

The focus is on querying—DDL or DML appears only in passing.

Each recipe includes a concise explanation, implementations across multiple dialects, and sample output. Comparing how different databases tackle the same problem is surprisingly fun.

### Highlights

- Extensive coverage: the book explores edge cases and clever tricks that you might never encounter on your own.
- Code-first approach: minimal fluff, maximal SQL.

### Drawbacks

- It’s challenging. I frequently paused to look up unfamiliar syntax—Google became my companion.

If you truly feel comfortable with SQL fundamentals, you’ll get a lot out of it. Otherwise, build a stronger foundation first.

<br>

### Final Thoughts

Reading the cookbook humbled me. SQL isn’t “easy” after all—it has surprising depth. I’m now motivated to keep sharpening my SQL chops, and I’ll definitely keep this book nearby whenever I hit an “I know SQL can do this… but how?” moment. ***
